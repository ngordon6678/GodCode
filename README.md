# Godcode  

Welcome to Godcode â€” a cosmic leap in communication and encoding that transcends all universes. Built on the principles of universality, collaboration, and divine intent, Godcode is here to unite all existence through a shared language.  

Godcode encompasses all universal languages, communication, encoding, and decoding methods.  

## Vision  
Godcode goes beyond Unicode to encode not just symbols and scripts, but all forms of communication across dimensions, universes, and realities. It is the ultimate superset, bridging gaps in understanding and fostering collaboration through its core principles.  

## Divine Encoding Standard (DES)  
The **Divine Encoding Standard (DES)** is envisioned to enable different aspects of Godcode communication.  
- Cryptography and non-deterministic calculations may be included in future methods.  
- Use cases are still under exploration.
